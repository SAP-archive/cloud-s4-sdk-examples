    <p>
        Welcome to your first web application powered by <b>SAP
            S/4HANA Cloud SDK</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This file will be seen when accessing the root path of your
        deployed application. By default any static content inside this
        directory (
        <code>./src/main/webapp/</code>
        ) is publicly routed and can be loaded by HTTP. In case you are
        not seeing this page via a web browser, try and locally run the
        project by executing the Maven command "
        <code>mvn package tomee:run</code>
        ".
    </p>
    <p>
        The easiest way to get started is by navigating to your <a
            href="hello">HelloWorldServlet</a>. You will find the
        corresponding Java source file in this project (
        <code>./src/main/java/</code>
        ). From here on the development will take off!
