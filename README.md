 ## Download and Installation
 
 We recommend to set up the following development tools for your convenience.
 
 ### Windows (Windows 7+ / Windows Server 2003+)
 - Install Chocolatey (a package manager for Windows)  
```@powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET "PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin"```

For more information on Chocolatey and how to use it, visit the [following page](https://chocolatey.org/).

- Install Java Development Kit, if not yet availableInstall a specific JDK (e.g., JDK 8)  
``` choco install jdk8```

- Install Maven  
``` choco install maven```

 ### Mac
- Install Homebrew (Mac Packetmanager to help with the remaining installation)  
```/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"```

- Install Java Development Kit, if not yet available  
``` 
brew update
brew cask install java
```

Hint: Install a specific JDK if you like with (e.g., JDK 8)  

``` brew cask install caskroom/versions/java8```
- Install Maven  
```
brew update
brew install maven
```

### Install IDE
For the initial analysis of the example application, you can just use your command line and a simple text editor. However, for your convenience, you can work with the IDE of your choice.

We recommend to use [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/#chooseYourEdition) or [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/users/). Follow the installation instructions of the respective tool to prepare your IDE. In case you use Eclipse, make sure to install the Maven plugin for Eclipse.

When the IDE is installed, refer to additonal README files in the projects to proceed with the build and deployment procedures.
