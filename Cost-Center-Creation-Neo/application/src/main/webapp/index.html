<h1>It works!</h1>
<p>
    Welcome to your first web application powered by <b>SAP S/4HANA Cloud SDK</b>.
</p>
<p>
    This file will be seen when accessing the root path of your deployed application. By default any static content
    inside this directory (<code>./src/main/webapp/</code>) is publicly routed and can be loaded by HTTP.
    In case you are not seeing this page via a web browser, try and locally run the project by executing the Maven
    command "<code>mvn package scp:push</code>".
</p>
<p>
    The easiest way to get started is by navigating to your <a href="hello">HelloWorldServlet</a>. You will find the
    corresponding Java source file in this project (<code>./src/main/java/</code>). From here on the development will
    take off!
